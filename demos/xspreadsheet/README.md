# x-spreadsheet

The `sheet_to_json` utility function generates output arrays suitable for use
with other JS libraries such as data grids for previewing data.  With a familiar
UI, [`x-spreadsheet`](https://myliang.github.io/x-spreadsheet/) is an excellent
choice for developers looking for a modern editor.

[The new docs](https://docs.sheetjs.com/docs/demos/grid/#x-spreadsheet)
include more detail and examples.

The original demo is available at <https://docs.sheetjs.com/xspreadsheet/>
